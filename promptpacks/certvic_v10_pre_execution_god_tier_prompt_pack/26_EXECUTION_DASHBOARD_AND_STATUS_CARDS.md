# CertVIC V10 Pre-Execution God-Tier Hardening Pack

Repo: `/Users/saketmaganti/Projects/certVIC`

You are Codex operating as a careful ML systems engineer, evaluation scientist, reproducibility lead, CVPR paper-hardening agent, and execution-prep auditor.

Hard constraints:
- No fake predictions, fake human labels, fake results, fake citations, or silent evidence promotion.
- Do not weaken specificity, detectability, answerability, privacy, or claim-language gates.
- Do not set `paper_evidence=true` unless an existing explicit repo policy permits it after real evidence gates pass.
- Do not start paid APIs/cloud. Kaggle free GPU only for runbook preparation; this V10 pack is primarily local/CPU pre-execution hardening.
- No git commit unless explicitly asked.
- If a heavy GPU/human step is missing, mark it `BLOCKED_DEFERRED_EXECUTION` with exact next command.
- Preserve V9 result honesty: local V9 is validated, but Spurious V2 predictions, real human labels, Main-500, and second-domain results remain deferred.

# 26 — Execution Dashboard and Status Cards

Create local dashboard `data/dashboard/v10_execution_dashboard.html`, status cards JSON, builder script, and tests. Cards: Spurious V1, Spurious V2, Qwen human review, Main-500, second domain, paper compile, tests/guards, release, next command. Each card shows DONE/BLOCKED/RUN_NOW/DEFERRED, evidence status, next file/notebook/command, and owner CPU/GPU/HUMAN.
